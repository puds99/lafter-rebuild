## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Lafter.org can achieve viral growth on Reddit by positioning itself as a mental wellness tool rather than a tracking app, focusing on authentic community engagement in self-improvement and mental health subreddits, and leveraging the platform's anonymity to encourage sharing of personal happiness journeys. Reddit's 116M daily active users and hostile-to-marketing culture demands a guerrilla approach: build genuine value through educational content, participate authentically for 2+ months before any mention of the app, and focus on comment-based organic discovery rather than promotional posts.

## TOP SUBREDDITS TO TARGET

1. r/GetMotivated (14M+ members) - WHY: Daily inspiration seekers - APPROACH: Share data insights about laughter's impact on motivation without mentioning app initially
2. r/DecidingToBeBetter (1.3M members) - WHY: People actively committing to change - APPROACH: Comment on posts about happiness/mood with scientific backing
3. r/selfimprovement (2.4M members) - WHY: Main hub for goal setting and habit building - APPROACH: Weekly "Laughter Challenge" threads once established
4. r/getdisciplined (2M members) - WHY: Focus on building habits - APPROACH: Position laughter tracking as measurable self-discipline metric
5. r/mentalhealth - WHY: Foundation audience for wellness tools - APPROACH: Share research on laughter therapy (never diagnose/prescribe)
6. r/Anxiety - WHY: Laughter as anxiety management tool - APPROACH: Gentle suggestions in comments about tracking positive moments
7. r/productivity - WHY: Quantified self enthusiasts - APPROACH: Frame as productivity booster backed by neuroscience
8. r/LifeProTips - WHY: Practical advice seekers - APPROACH: "LPT: Track your laughs to identify what truly makes you happy"
9. r/GetMotivatedBuddies - WHY: Accountability partners - APPROACH: Suggest laugh tracking as shared goal
10. r/SideProject - WHY: Indie app appreciation - APPROACH: Building in public posts about development journey
11. r/InternetIsBeautiful - WHY: Unique web apps get featured - APPROACH: Submit when you have beautiful visualization feature

## ZERO-EFFORT TACTICS

1. **The Scientific Commenter**: Create infographics about laughter science, share in relevant threads without app mention. Bio link does the work.

2. **The Data Storyteller**: "I tracked my laughs for 30 days and discovered..." posts with compelling visualizations (mention app only if asked).

3. **The Helper Bot**: Monitor keywords "mood tracker" "happiness app" "track emotions" - provide helpful comparisons including Lafter naturally.

4. **Cross-Platform Virality**: When something goes viral on TikTok/Twitter about laughter/happiness, be first to share on relevant subreddits.

5. **AMA Goldmine**: "I'm a developer who tracks every laugh - AMA" in r/IAmA or r/casualiama after 3 months of community building.

6. **The Comparison Thread**: Create comprehensive comparison of mood tracking apps in r/productivity, include Lafter honestly among Daylio, Bearable, etc.

7. **Meme Momentum**: Create relatable memes about "that friend who never laughs" or "when you realize you haven't laughed in 3 days" for r/meirl.
