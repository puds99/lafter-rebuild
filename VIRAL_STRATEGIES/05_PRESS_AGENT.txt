## PRODUCTHUNT STRATEGY

### Critical Changes in 2025
- Only 10% of launches get featured (down from 60-98% in previous years)
- Featured status determines 70% of success - without it, zero visibility
- Manual curation by PH team based on practicality and benefit
- Bots and manipulation are rampant - genuine engagement crucial

### 2-Month Pre-Launch Plan

**Month 1:**
- Create Coming Soon page immediately
- Engage daily: upvote and comment on 3-5 products
- Build email list of 500+ supporters
- Connect with other launching founders for mutual support
- Document product development for authenticity

**Month 2:**
- Reach out to 100+ active PH users personally
- Create teaser content and demos
- Prepare all assets: screenshots, GIFs, video demo
- Schedule for Sunday launch (less competition)
- Line up 50+ committed first-hour supporters

### Launch Day Execution
- Launch at 12:01 AM PST Sunday
- First hour: engage your core 50 supporters
- Focus on long-time PH users first (weighted higher)
- Ask for visits and comments, not upvotes (against rules)
- Stay active all day responding to comments
- Share updates every 4 hours across channels

### Expected Outcomes
- If featured: 1,000-5,000 visitors, 10-150 signups, DR 91 backlink
- If not featured: 100-500 visitors, 1-15 signups
- Time investment: 50-120 hours total preparation

## PRESS RELEASE TEMPLATE

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**Lafter.org Launches First App to Track and Improve Mental Health Through Laughter Therapy**

*New wellness app gamifies scientifically-proven laughter techniques shown to reduce anxiety by 83% in recent studies*

[CITY, Date] - As mental health apps reach a $6.49 billion market valuation, Lafter.org introduces a radically different approach: tracking and increasing daily laughter as a measurable health metric. The app launches amid new research confirming laughter therapy's significant impact on anxiety reduction and life satisfaction.

**The Problem:** Despite spending billions on wellness apps, anxiety and depression rates continue climbing. Traditional meditation and mindfulness apps have a 90% abandonment rate within 30 days.

**The Solution:** Lafter.org makes mental wellness active and measurable by:
- Tracking daily laughter frequency and quality
- Providing science-backed laughter exercises
- Creating social challenges that build connection
- Showing correlations between laughter and mood

**The Science:** A 2025 meta-analysis of 17 studies published in the British Journal of Guidance & Counselling found laughter therapy produces significant medium effects on mental health improvement (Hedges' g = 0.774), with particular effectiveness for stress, anxiety, and depression.

**Quote from Founder:** "We track steps, heart rate, and sleep, but nobody's measuring joy. Lafter turns laughter from an accident into an intention - a daily practice as important as exercise."

**Availability:** Lafter.org is available now on [iOS/Android] as a free download with premium features.

**About Lafter.org:** Founded in 2024, Lafter.org is dedicated to making mental wellness accessible, measurable, and enjoyable through the power of laughter.
