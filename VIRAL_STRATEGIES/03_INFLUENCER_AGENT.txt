## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Lafter.org can leverage micro-influencer partnerships without budget through product seeding strategies that have proven 5-13x ROI for similar apps. Comedy creators, mental health advocates, and morning show hosts represent prime targets who naturally align with laugh-tracking technology. The key is focusing on creators with 5K-50K followers who deliver 3-8% engagement rates versus 1-2% for larger influencers. Free access to premium features, early beta access, and co-created content opportunities can replace monetary compensation while building authentic advocacy.
