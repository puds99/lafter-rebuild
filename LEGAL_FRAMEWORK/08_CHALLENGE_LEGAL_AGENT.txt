AGENT: Viral Challenge Legal Specialist
RESEARCH DATE: November 23, 2025

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Viral challenges involving multi-user content combination operate in a complex legal landscape governed primarily by platform Terms of Service, implied consent through feature enablement, and copyright law. The TikTok Duet model provides the most established framework, relying on opt-in settings as presumptive consent for content combination. Key considerations include derivative works rights, partial takedown scenarios, and the need for explicit collaboration agreements when content extends beyond platform boundaries.

## MULTI-USER CONTENT RIGHTS

### Ownership Structure
- Original creators retain copyright to their individual contributions
- Combined/derivative works create new copyright interests
- Platform Terms of Service grant broad licenses enabling combination features
- Users grant platforms "unconditional irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully transferable, perpetual worldwide license" to use, modify, adapt, and create derivative works

### Opt-Out Scenarios
- Once content is incorporated into a challenge/duet, removal of original doesn't affect existing derivatives
- TikTok model: "If you allow others to Duet with your video but then change your settings or delete your video, any existing Duets that have already been made will remain on TikTok"
- No unified system for partial takedowns where one participant wants removal from combined content
- DMCA counternotice process available but impractical for viral content (2-week delay)

## TIKTOK DUET MODEL

### Legal Framework
- Features like Duet/Stitch permitted under platform ToS without direct consent requirement
- "Through-to-the-Audience Rights" - users have no rights against third parties who use content via platform services
- Privacy settings act as consent mechanism:
  * Everyone (public consent)
  * Friends only (limited consent)
  * Only you (no consent)

### Consent Mechanism
- Presumption of consent from having Duets enabled provides legal protection
- Public account requirement for Duet participation
- Settings control prospective use only - existing duets remain after settings change
- Creator of duet controls privacy/distribution of combined work

## CHALLENGE PARTICIPATION = CONSENT

### Implicit Consent Language Needed:
"By participating in this challenge and using designated hashtags/features, you grant permission for your content to be combined with other participants' submissions for challenge compilation videos. You retain ownership of your original submission."

### Explicit vs Implicit Consent:
- **Implicit**: Enabled through feature settings (Duet on/off), hashtag use, challenge participation
- **Explicit**: Required for commercial use, off-platform distribution, or extended licensing
- Platform ToS provides baseline consent but may not cover all use cases
- Challenges using content beyond platform require additional agreements

### Recommended Consent Hierarchy:
1. Platform ToS (baseline)
2. Feature settings (Duet/Stitch enabled)
3. Challenge participation (hashtag use)
4. Explicit opt-in for commercial/extended use

## PARTIAL TAKEDOWN SCENARIOS

### User A Wants Out, Users B/C Don't:
- **Current Reality**: No established mechanism for partial removal from combined works
- **Platform Response**: Typically all-or-nothing (entire video removed or retained)
- **Legal Complexity**: Each participant may have copyright interest in combined work

### Solutions:
1. **Time-Limited Challenges**: Set expiration dates for challenge compilations
2. **Modular Architecture**: Store individual submissions separately, dynamically combine
3. **Opt-Out Registry**: Maintain list of users requesting removal, exclude from future compilations
4. **Version Control**: Create new versions excluding opted-out participants
5. **Clear Exit Terms**: Define in challenge rules what happens if participant withdraws

## RECOMMENDED FRAMEWORK

### 1. Pre-Challenge Setup
- Define ownership structure upfront

- Maintain individual submission records
- Track consent status per participant

### 3. Post-Challenge Management
- Honor opt-out requests for future use
- Maintain existing compilations per platform policy
- Provide attribution to all participants
- Handle DMCA notices promptly

### 4. Content Architecture
- Store original submissions separately
- Create compilations dynamically when possible
- Maintain version history
- Enable granular removal capabilities

### 5. Risk Mitigation
- Obtain explicit consent for commercial use
- Use platform commercial music libraries only
- Avoid dangerous/harmful challenge themes
- Implement content moderation protocols
