AGENT: DMCA & Takedown Process Specialist
RESEARCH DATE: November 23, 2025

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

To operate Lafter.org safely with user-generated laugh content, you need a robust takedown system that complies with DMCA safe harbor requirements. The system must handle takedown requests "expeditiously" (no specific 24-hour rule, but fast response expected), maintain detailed documentation for legal protection, and provide a counter-notification process. YouTube's Content ID offers a sophisticated model, but a simpler manual system with basic automation can meet legal requirements for a startup.

## YOUTUBE'S SYSTEM (MODEL TO FOLLOW)

### How Content ID Works
- Scans 500+ hours of video per minute against a database of copyrighted content
- Creates digital fingerprints for registered content
- Automatically detects matches and allows rightsholders to block, monetize, or track
- 90% of rightsholders choose to monetize rather than block (2022 data)
- Handled over 1.5 billion claims in 2024

### Takedown Workflow
1. Video gets claimed by automated algorithm
2. Creator can accept claim, share revenue, remove content, or dispute
3. Dispute process: Rightsholder has 30 days to respond
4. Appeal stage: Can escalate to 7-day response window
5. Final option: DMCA takedown (results in copyright strike)
6. Three strikes = account termination

### Counter-Claims Process
- User disputes the match
- Rightsholder can release or uphold claim
- User can appeal rightsholder's decision
- Rightsholder must file lawsuit within 10-14 days or content is restored
- Full dispute resolution can take 30+ days

## MINIMUM VIABLE TAKEDOWN SYSTEM

### 1. Request Submission
Required Elements for Valid DMCA Notice:
- Clear description of copyrighted material
- Evidence of ownership
- Direct URL to each infringing item
- Statement of good faith belief
- Statement under penalty of perjury
- Physical or electronic signature
- Contact information

### 2. Verification Process
- Check notice contains all required elements
- Verify URLs point to actual content on your platform
- Document receipt timestamp
- Generate case number for tracking
- Send acknowledgment to complainant

### 3. Removal Timeline
- "Expeditiously" remove content (law doesn't specify hours, but faster is safer)
- Industry practice: 24-48 hours for initial response
- Immediately disable access upon valid notice
- Notify user who posted content
- Provide copy of takedown notice to user

### 4. Notification System
To User:
- Content has been removed/disabled
- Copy of takedown notice
- Instructions for filing counter-notice
- Warning about repeat infringer policy

To Complainant:
- Confirmation of content removal
- Case reference number
- Next steps if counter-notice filed

### 5. Counter-Notification Process
User Requirements:
- Identification of removed material and location
- Statement under penalty of perjury that removal was mistake/misidentification
- Consent to jurisdiction of federal court
- Physical or electronic signature
- Contact information

Platform Actions:
- Forward counter-notice to original complainant
- Inform complainant they have 10-14 business days to file lawsuit
- If no lawsuit filed, restore content after 10-14 days
- Document all communications

## SAFE HARBOR REQUIREMENTS

### What You Must Do to Be Protected

1. **Designate a DMCA Agent**
   - Register agent with U.S. Copyright Office ($6 fee)
   - Display agent contact info prominently on website

2. **Implement Repeat Infringer Policy**
   - Create written policy
   - Publish in Terms of Service
   - Track strikes against users
   - Terminate repeat offenders
   - Document enforcement actions

3. **No Direct Financial Benefit**
   - Cannot profit directly from infringing content
   - Must not have ability to control infringing activity
   - Ad revenue generally acceptable if not tied to specific infringing content

4. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Log all takedown notices received
   - Track response times
   - Document all actions taken
   - Maintain records of counter-notices
   - Keep audit trail of repeat infringers
   - Store records for at least 3 years (best practice)

5. **Technical Compliance**
   - Don't interfere with "standard technical measures"
   - Respect digital watermarks or content ID systems
   - Allow copyright owners to use protection technologies

YouTube's Content ID represents the gold standard, but a basic compliant system can be implemented for under $2000 in the first year. Focus on getting the legal foundation right before adding sophisticated automation.
